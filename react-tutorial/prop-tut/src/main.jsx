/* 
 Using Spread Operator (...) and Props ‚úÖ
 
üöÄ Code Flow Explanation : 

1Ô∏è‚É£ The BookList component imports the books array (which contains book details).
2Ô∏è‚É£ It uses .map() to loop through the array, dynamically creating a Book component for each book.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Each Book component receives props using the spread operator (...book), passing down all object properties.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The Book component extracts the title, author, and image and renders them inside an <article>.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The BookList component returns the list of books, which gets displayed in the UI.
